- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design
- Continue developing and testing new features directly within the authenticated Figma interface
- Preserve original Figma design while adding functionality

## System Architecture
The application utilizes a full-stack architecture with clear client-server separation.
- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite, `wouter` for routing, `TanStack Query` for state management, and `shadcn/ui` (Radix UI) for components, adhering to the original Figma design.
- **Backend**: Express server written in TypeScript.
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth for secure session management.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Key Features**: Includes modules for Job Cards, Appointments, Tool Management, Customer Management, Purchase Orders, Invoicing, Reporting, Vehicle Management (service history, VIN decoding, reminders), Estimates & Quotes, SMS Notifications (Twilio), Scheduling & Calendar, Inventory & Parts Management (low stock alerts, barcode scanning, TecDoc integration), Advanced Financial Features (multi-provider payments, payment plans, tax automation, profit margin analysis), Search & Filtering (global search, advanced filters, bulk operations, data import/export), Business Intelligence & Analytics (customer lifetime value, profitable services, peak hours, technician utilization), Staff & HR Management (time tracking, shift scheduling, commission calculation, performance reviews), AI Automation & Insights (AI-powered estimations, predictive maintenance, parts recommendations, schedule optimization, AI chatbot via Replit AI/OpenAI gpt-5), Third-Party Integrations (Google Calendar, Gmail), and Security & Compliance (2FA via speakeasy, audit logging, data backup/restore, GDPR tools, granular permissions).
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Preserves Figma design, ensures responsiveness, and uses a consistent component-based approach with tabbed interfaces. Implements PWA support, mobile-responsive navigation, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility features. Includes an offline mode with service worker caching. The sidebar navigation is reorganized into 11 logical, collapsible groups.
- **Technical Implementations**: Form validation uses Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend. Comprehensive user settings, print system, undo/redo system, keyboard shortcuts, and a robust currency system are implemented. Action history is tracked for audit trails.
